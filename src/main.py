#This is the place to execute the main code for stage 1
#This code will: 
# read GHG data(use functions, os relative path)
# compile into numpy arrays, 
# initialize constants(climate sensitivity, initial gas concentrations)
# run model functions, 
# create necessary output arrays for visualization
# run visualization code
